                <h2>Historical Perspective on Computing</h2>
                <p>Computing as we know it has evolved over centuries, starting with the earliest mechanical devices to the sophisticated AI systems we use today. Below are some of the most significant milestones:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1837:</strong> Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine, the first mechanical general-purpose computer. Although never completed, this concept paved the way for programmable machines.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1936:</strong> Alan Turing introduced the concept of a "universal machine," capable of performing any computation given the right algorithm. This idea became the foundation of computer science.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1943-1944:</strong> The Colossus computer, developed by British engineers during World War II, was the first programmable digital computer. It was used to decipher German military codes, highlighting the strategic value of computing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1971:</strong> Intel released the 4004 microprocessor, the first commercially available processor. This invention marked the beginning of the microcomputer revolution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1981:</strong> IBM launched its first personal computer (PC), which introduced the concept of computing for individual use and set industry standards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>2007:</strong> Apple unveiled the first iPhone, blending computing and communication in a handheld device. This innovation redefined how we interact with technology in our daily lives.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Computing has profoundly impacted society, enabling breakthroughs in science, communication, and commerce. From automating tasks to connecting people worldwide, its influence continues to grow.</p>
